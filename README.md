# Maven-sales-Analytics-challenge

For the Maven Sales Challenge, I've played the role of a BI Developer for MavenTech, a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. They've been using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities but have no visibility of the data outside of the platform.

The dataset for this project consisted of (5) separate tables in a CSV format. These tables were imported into PowerBI where data cleaning, formatting or manipulation was done. The tables imported were:
Accounts - general information for customers including location, industry type and revenue generated.
Data Dictionary - description of variables used in each table.
Products - listing of products supplied by MavenTech and their sales price.
Sales Pipeline - where the individual sales are logged along with agent, sales values and deal stage.
Sales Teams - provides the MavenTech team breakdown by region, area manager then agents.
The project focuses on Sales Managers, each overseeing three specific regions in the United States. The hierarchy is organized by region, Sales Manager, and their respective agents. Users can view individual regions or an overall summary.
